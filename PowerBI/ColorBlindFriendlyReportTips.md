# The best charts for color blind viewers





   How do we see the world in colors? It all starts with the light. The light can come from the Sun, fire or a lamp sending waves of different lengths. The surfaces around us have different capacities for absorbing wavelengths, so some of the waves are absorbed, while others are reflected. The ones that are reflected can be perceived by our eyes. These waves go through the cornea and pupil and hit the retina. The retina consists of cones and rods. Cones are the ones that are responsible for color perception. The combination of waves that hit the cones form in our brain the perception of color.

   There are three types of cones: The first type is sensitive to long wavelengths (starting from red, peaking at yellow, and declining at green). The second type is sensitive to middle wavelengths (starting at orange, peaking at green, and declining at blue). The third type is sensitive to short wavelengths (starting at green and peaking at blue).

   ## What colors can color blind people see?
Actually, it depends on what type of cones don't work. There are three common types: protanopia (red-blind), deuteranopia (green-blind), and tritanopia (blue-blind). There can also be an intermediate state, color weakness - when the colors can be distinguished but some of the hue details are lost. There’s also a very rare state when all the cones are not working and the person is completely color blind – it’s called complete achromatopsia. In the next picture, the simulation of what colors can color blind people see is presented.

## Color blind palette
The picture below shows that for all of the types of color blindness there is a pair of colors that can be distinguished – red and blue – these are color blind safe colors. As for the green, it is the number one among the colors to avoid for the color blind. Most of the issues for colorblind people come from the prevalence of red-and-green combinations as a pair of opposites in design. The first rule of making a palette for colorblind – avoid combining red and green. So if you’re aiming to create a color blind-friendly palette try to use only two basic hues: blue and red (orange and yellow will also fit). The other colors should be made out of these two hues. All the variations can be made by using different saturation or lightness of the basic color. Based on these rules we’ve created a color blind palette and checked it for three color blindness types.
